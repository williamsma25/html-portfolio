<h2>My Top 3 Movies of 2023.</h2>

<hr />


<h3>Leave the World Behind</h3>

<p>
    
    This movie was really mind bending. Makes you really think about how dependent on technology, we are as a society.

<h3>Transformers: Rise of Beasts</h3>

<p>

    This movie was hilarious and my wife made me watch it like 5 times the first week we bought it.

<h3>The Last Voyage of the Demeter</h3>

<p>
    This was a great vampire movie. I dont usually go for this genre of movie and I was pleasantly suprised by the storyline.
